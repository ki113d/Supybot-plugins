WebStats is a plugin that provide a web access to channel based statistics.

It is designed to be used on active channels, so it implements a cache system.
Don't worry if you have enabled statistics and nothing happens on the Web
interface in the following hour.

You need pygraphviz (python-pygraphviz in Debian) for the "links" graph.
